## Overview

### Test task

"The doctor sees from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

A local file with busy time intervals is provided.

Based on the information received, it is required to create a list of free windows for 30 minutes.

P.S. The design of the UI is at your discretion".

**Additionally**, a fake appointment with a doctor has been implemented with the removal of the selected session from the free list and the addition of a busy interval in the store.
